# Ad-hoc-sign the built .app bundle with the entitlements needed for mic /
# system-audio capture. Run after every rebuild that touches the executable —
# changing the binary invalidates the signature, and TCC permission grants
# follow the code-signing hash.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/sign-app.sh                                 # signs .build/CallCapture.app
#   ./Scripts/sign-app.sh path/to/CallCapture.app         # signs an arbitrary bundle
#
# Notes:
# - The entitlements file lives at Scripts/entitlements.plist so it's
#   version-controlled and cannot disappear from the bundle output (an earlier
#   build shipped Contents/entitlements.plist as decoration; codesign was never
#   given --entitlements, so the signature carried only get-task-allow and the
#   IOProc silently received zero frames).
# - We use the ad-hoc identity (`--sign -`) plus `--options runtime` and
#   `--generate-entitlement-der` so the entitlements + Info.plist are properly
#   sealed. `--identifier com.callcapture.app` matches CFBundleIdentifier.
