# Voice Intelligence & Recording Types — Design

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** Approved (pending written-spec review)
**Depends on:** baseline commit `64b13a5` (capture + transcription + notes working)

---

## 1. Goal

Turn Call Capture from a call recorder into a general **audio-notes recorder with
voice intelligence**. After a recording, the app:

- knows the **recording type** (Call/Meeting, Voice memo, Lecture) and processes accordingly,
- separates and counts **speakers** (diarization, where applicable),
- computes **talk metrics**, **sentiment** (text + acoustic emotion), and
  **conversation insights** (type-tailored, including psychological/negotiation
  advantage for calls),
- writes a structured Markdown note shaped per type.

All LLM work runs through **OpenRouter**. Heavy analysis runs **locally by default**
(privacy), with a **cloud provider** seam for later.

Built **post-call now**, with component seams that a future **live mode** can reuse.

## 2. Recording Types → Processing Profiles

Every type runs **metrics, sentiment, acoustic emotion, and insights**. Only two
things differ per type: whether **diarization** runs, and the **note shape / LLM
prompt template**.

| Type | Diarization | Note shape (sections) |
|---|---|---|
| **Call / Meeting** | yes | Participants, Sentiment, Conversation Insights (advantage + action items), Transcript |
| **Voice memo** | no (solo = "You") | Summary, Key points, Action items, Reflections |
| **Lecture / talk** | optional (separate main speaker / Q&A) | Outline, Key concepts, Summary, Q&A, Takeaways |

A profile is therefore: `{ diarization: Bool, note_template: String, insight_template: String }`.
The type set is an extensible enum (Interview etc. can be added later).

**Selection UX:**
- A **type picker in the menu popover before recording** (default: Call/Meeting).
- The type is **editable in Session Detail** before (re)processing, so a wrong
  type can be corrected and the analysis re-run.

## 3. Capture — Separate Stems

The IOProc already receives the mic and system-output streams as **separate
buffers** (today we sum them to mono). Change:

- **Mic selected:** write the mixed `<id>.wav` (playback master, unchanged) **plus**
  `<id>_mic.wav` ("You") and `<id>_system.wav` (remote) stems for analysis.
- **No mic:** write `<id>.wav` only — already output-only, so it doubles as the
  remote stem.

Each stem is 16 kHz mono (same converter path as today, applied per buffer instead
of summed). Stem writing is gated by "analysis enabled".

## 4. Worker Analysis Pipeline (new `analyze` stage)

Runs after transcription, orchestrated by the recording-type profile:

1. **Transcribe** (existing). With stems: transcribe `_mic` → "You" segments and
   `_system` → remote segments. Without stems: transcribe the single file.
2. **Diarize** (if profile.diarization): pyannote on the remote stem → speaker turns;
   assign remote transcript segments to Speaker A/B/… by max time-overlap. "You"
   comes from the mic stem directly.
3. **Talk metrics** (always): per-speaker seconds, talk-ratio %, word count,
   words/min, turn count, interruptions (overlapping turn starts), longest monologue,
   silence/pause ratio.
4. **Acoustic emotion** (always): a local speech-emotion model over each speaker's
   segments → emotion label + valence/arousal, aggregated per speaker and as an arc.
5. **Sentiment** (always, LLM via OpenRouter): overall + per-speaker sentiment from
   the labeled transcript, reconciled with acoustic emotion.
6. **Insights** (always, LLM via OpenRouter): type-tailored. Call → dominance,
   momentum shifts, agreement/hesitation/objection signals, persuasion openings,
   recommended next moves. Memo → clarity, open loops, next actions. Lecture → key
   takeaways, gaps.
7. **Validate** (Pydantic) and write `<id>_analysis.json` + the type-shaped Markdown
   note. Atomic writes (temp + rename).

Failures degrade gracefully: if diarization or emotion fails, the note is still
produced from transcription + LLM with a warning; the job does not hard-fail.

## 5. LLM via OpenRouter

Replace the direct Anthropic SDK in post-processing with an **OpenAI-compatible
client** pointed at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. Model is configurable (e.g.
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `openai/gpt-4o`). API key in Keychain. All LLM
calls — note formatting, sentiment, insights — go through one `OpenRouterClient`
wrapper with retry + JSON-mode parsing.

Long transcripts (>~30 min) use hierarchical summarization (chunk → per-chunk
summary → synthesize), per the existing spec.

## 6. Diarization & Emotion — local default, cloud seam

- **Diarization:** local `pyannote.audio` (needs PyTorch + a free HuggingFace token,
  stored in Keychain). A `DiarizationProvider` protocol lets a cloud provider
  (AssemblyAI/Deepgram) be slotted in later via `analysis_provider` setting.
- **Acoustic emotion:** local SER model (e.g. `emotion2vec`/wav2vec2-SER via torch),
  behind an `EmotionAnalyzer` protocol.
- Models download on first use to `~/Library/Application Support/CallCapture/models/`.

Bundle-size impact (torch + models, ~GB) is acceptable in the dev venv and is a
known item for the packaging milestone; an ONNX-based lighter path is a future
optimization.

## 7. Data Model

New Pydantic models in the worker:

```
SpeakerStats { label, is_self, talk_seconds, talk_ratio, words, words_per_min,
               turns, interruptions, dominant_emotion, valence, arousal }
Sentiment    { overall, by_speaker: {label -> score/label}, arc: [ {t, score} ] }
Insights     { summary, dynamics, opportunities[], recommended_actions[],
               type_specific: {…} }
ConversationAnalysis { recording_type, num_speakers, speakers: [SpeakerStats],
                       sentiment: Sentiment, insights: Insights, warnings[] }
```

`TranscriptSegment` gains a reliable `speaker` label. `JobRequest` gains
`recording_type`. `JobResult` gains `analysis_path`.

SQLite: `session` gains `recording_type` and `analysis_path` columns (migration).
Swift `Session` and `SessionRecord` mirror them.

## 8. Output & UI

- **Markdown note** per type (frontmatter: `recording_type`, `participants`,
  `num_speakers`, `sentiment`, plus existing fields). Call note includes
  Participants (talk-ratio table), Sentiment, Conversation Insights, speaker-labeled
  Transcript.
- **Menu popover:** recording-type picker above the device pickers (default
  Call/Meeting).
- **Session Detail:** a **Conversation Insights** GroupBox — speaker count,
  talk-ratio bars, sentiment + emotion per speaker, and recommended actions; plus a
  **recording-type selector** with a Re-process action.

## 9. Settings

- `enable_analysis` (default true)
- `analysis_provider` = `local` | `assemblyai` | `deepgram` (default `local`;
  only `local` implemented in v1, others are seams)
- `openrouter_api_key` (Keychain), `llm_model` (string, default a Claude model)
- `huggingface_token` (Keychain, for pyannote)
- `default_recording_type`
- Existing `enable_diarization` folds into per-type profile defaults.

## 10. Dependencies

Worker adds: `pyannote.audio`, `torch`, an SER model package, and an
OpenAI-compatible client (`openai`). The existing `anthropic` dependency is dropped
from the LLM path (OpenRouter replaces it).

## 11. Testing

- **Python unit (≥80% on new modules):** talk-metrics math from synthetic
  diarization; profile selection; schema validation; OpenRouter client JSON parsing
  (mocked HTTP); insight/sentiment prompt construction; graceful-degradation paths.
  Diarizer, emotion model, and LLM are mocked.
- **Swift:** stem-routing unit coverage where feasible; recording-type persistence;
  end-to-end verified via a real recording (mic + group audio) → both stems → analysis
  JSON → note.

## 12. Scope & Phasing

This is a large spec; the implementation plan will phase it:

1. **Foundation:** recording-type enum + profiles, type picker UX, DB migration,
   `recording_type` plumbing, OpenRouter client replacing Anthropic.
2. **Capture:** separate stems.
3. **Diarization + talk metrics** (local pyannote) and speaker attribution.
4. **Acoustic emotion + sentiment** (local SER + OpenRouter).
5. **Insights** (type-tailored prompts) + Markdown note shapes.
6. **UI:** Session Detail insights + type selector + re-process.

## 13. Out of Scope (v1)

- Live/real-time analysis (architecture leaves seams; not built).
- Cloud analysis providers (interface defined; not implemented).
- Interview and other extra types (enum is extensible).
- Distribution bundling of torch/models (packaging milestone).
